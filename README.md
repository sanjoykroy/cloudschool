Cloud School
============

<p>This project is based on the talk given by Sugata Mitra in TED. He is the winner of the 2013 TED Prize for this concept.</p>

<p>Dr. Sugata Mitra spoke about his wish in TED:</p>

<i>“My wish is to help design the future of learning by supporting children all over the world to tap into their innate sense of wonder and work together. Help me build the School in the Cloud, a learning lab in India, where children can embark on intellectual adventures by engaging and connecting with information and mentoring online. I also invite you, wherever you are, to create your own miniature child-driven learning environments and share your discoveries.”</i>
